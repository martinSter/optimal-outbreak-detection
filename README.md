# Optimal Outbreak Detection for Temporal Contact Networks

This repository contains the escort data initially collected and analyzed by Rocha et al. (2011) and the code for our optimal outbreak detection approach.

A previous version of our approach has been presented at the Complex Networks conference 2019 (Sterchi et al., 2019).
